# AI Engineering

A comprehensive collection of AI engineering projects designed as an **executable codebase** - where both humans and AI agents can discover and run available tools through a unified interface. This repository demonstrates practical implementations across cloud infrastructure, AI inference systems, and graph-based AI architectures.

## 🎯 Project Philosophy: Executable Codebase

This repository embodies a core principle: **the codebase itself should be executable by both humans and AI agents**. Every tool, command, and capability is discoverable and runnable through a unified interface.

### For AI Agents 🤖

```bash
make help  # Same interface - AI agents can parse and execute tools
```

**Key Principles:**

- **Single Source of Truth**: The Makefile serves as the authoritative catalog of all executable operations
- **Self-Documenting**: Every command includes clear descriptions and usage examples
- **Universal Access**: The same interface works for humans, CI/CD systems, and AI agents
- **Discoverability**: No hidden commands - everything is accessible via `make help`

## 🎯 Project Goals

This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio demonstrating:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automated cloud infrastructure provisioning
- **AI Inference Systems**: Production-ready AI model deployment  
- **DevOps Best Practices**: CI/CD, automation, and monitoring
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Interfaces designed for both human and AI agent interaction
- **Learning in Public**: Documented journey through AI engineering

## 🏗️ Current Projects

### 1. AI Inference Infrastructure (`infrastructure/ai-inference/`)

A complete infrastructure solution for deploying AI inference workloads on AWS using custom AMIs and modular OpenTofu configuration.

**Key Features:**

- Custom Ubuntu 24.04 AMI with Docker, NVIDIA drivers, and GPU support
- Modular architecture: separate IAM, inference, and reusable modules
- Multi-model deployment: Qwen 3 0.6B, GPT-OSS 20B, and Gemma 3 27B configurations
- vLLM server with systemd integration and container lifecycle management
- GPU-enabled instances (g5.2xlarge) with automated provisioning
- Comprehensive security: EBS encryption, restrictive security groups, IAM best practices

**Quick Deploy:**

```bash
# Build custom AMI
make ami-build

# Deploy IAM resources
make tofu-iam-apply

# Deploy inference infrastructure
make tofu-inference-apply
```

### 2. OSS Agent Example (`agents/oss-agent/`)

A practical example of building AI agents using open source models with comprehensive documentation.

**Key Features:**

- OpenAI-compatible API integration for local models (vLLM, Ollama)
- Function calling with Wikipedia search tools
- Interactive REPL with Rich formatting
- Comprehensive comments explaining agent patterns and OSS model usage

**Quick Start:**

```bash
cd agents/oss-agent
python main.py  # Interactive agent with Wikipedia search
```

### 3. LangChain Sample Agent (`agents/course/langchain/`)

A minimal LangChain agent example that demonstrates tool calling with a simple local toolset.

**Key Features:**

- `create_agent`-based setup with a compact, readable implementation
- Built-in tools for arithmetic and UTC time lookup
- CLI prompt override for easy experimentation

**Quick Start:**

```bash
make agent-langchain-run
```

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Infrastructure**: OpenTofu (Terraform), Packer, AWS (EC2, EBS, VPC, IAM)
- **AI/ML**: vLLM, Python, GPU acceleration, OpenAI-compatible APIs
- **Containerization**: Docker, systemd service management
- **Automation**: Make, Bash scripting, GitHub Actions
- **Security**: EBS encryption, security groups, IAM best practices

## 📋 Executable Tool Catalog

The project's **Makefile serves as the executable interface** - a programmatically parseable catalog of all available tools. This design enables both humans and AI agents to discover and execute operations using the same commands.

### 🔍 Tool Discovery

```bash
make help  # Lists all available tools with descriptions
```
